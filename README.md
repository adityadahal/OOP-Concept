# OOP-Concepts

### Class
Class is a collection of Objects. It doesn't take any space on memory. Space is taken for Class when Object for that class is made. Class is also called as blueprint or template from which objects are created. <br/> For Example: *Student is a class where particular student Aditya is an Object*
<br/>
### Object 
 Object is a member (an instance) of Class which takes memory. An Object has an Identity, State and Behaviour. <br/> For Example : *A catâ€™s state includes its color, size, gender, and age, while its behavior is sleeping, purring, meowing for food, or running around like crazy at 4 AM.*.
