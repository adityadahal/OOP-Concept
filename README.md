# OOP-Concepts
OOP stands for <b>Object Oriented Programming </b> <br/> 
Procedural Programming is about writing Procedures or Methods to perform any operation, while Object Oriented Programming is about creating Objects that contain data and method.

### Class
Class is a collection of Objects. It doesn't take any space on memory. Space is taken for Class when Object for that class is made. Class is also called as blueprint or template from which objects are created. <br/> For Example: *Student is a class where particular student Aditya is an Object*
<br/>
### Object 
 Object is a member (an instance) of Class which takes memory. An Object has an  State and Behaviour. <br/> For Example : *A catâ€™s state includes its color, size, gender, and age, while its behavior is sleeping, purring, meowing for food, or running around like crazy at 4 AM.*.
 <br/>
 ### Method
  Method is a programmed procedure defined as part of that class and is available to object initialized from that class. Each Object can call the method of their respective classes.
 ### Constructor
 Constructor is a special type of method whose name is same as method name. Whenever we use new keyword to create instance(member) of class, Constructor is invoked(called) and Object of class is returned. Since, Constructor can only return Object of the class we are not supposed to add return type to it. If return type is added to the constructor it becomes method of the class, In this way Constructor and Method are distinguished.
