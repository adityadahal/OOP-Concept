# OOP-Concepts
OOP stands for <b>Object Oriented Programming </b> <br/> 
Procedural Programming is about writing Procedures or Methods to perform any operation, while Object Oriented Programming is about creating Objects that contain data and method.

### Class
Class is a collection of Objects. It doesn't take any space on memory. Space is taken for Class when Object for that class is made. Class is also called as blueprint or template from which objects are created. <br/> For Example: *Student is a class where particular student Aditya is an Object*
<br/>
### Object 
 Object is a member (an instance) of Class which takes memory. An Object has an  State and Behaviour. <br/> For Example : *A catâ€™s state includes its color, size, gender, and age, while its behavior is sleeping, purring, meowing for food, or running around like crazy at 4 AM.*.
 <br/>
 ### Method
  Method is a programmed procedure defined as part of that class and is available to object initialized from that class. Each Object can call the method of their respective classes.
  <br/>
 ### Constructor
 Constructor is a special type of method whose name is same as method name. Whenever we use new keyword to create instance(member) of class, Constructor is invoked(called) and Object of class is returned. Since, Constructor can only return Object of the class we are not supposed to add return type to it. If return type is added to the constructor it becomes method of the class, In this way Constructor and Method are distinguished. 
 <br/>
 
### Encapsulation
  The main concept of Encapuslation is to make sure that 'sensitive' data is hidden from users. It is used to hide the value or state of structured data objects inside the class to prevent direct access from unauthorized access. <br/> To achieve Encapsulation you must:
 - declare class attributes/variables private.
 - provide public <b>get</b> and <b>set</b> methods to access those private variables and update those private variables. <br/>
### Get and Set Methods
private variables can only be access within that class (outside class has no access). It is possible to access the private attributes/variable when we provide get and set method to it. The get method returns the variable value and set method sets the value. Syntax for both is that they start with either get or set, followed by the name of the variable, with the first letter in upper case: <br/>

<br/> <b>this</b> keyword is used to refer current object and other is used to refer from parameterized object.

<br/>
### Inheritance
Inheritance is the concept to import the attribute and methods from one class to another. 'Inheritance concept' is grouped in two categories:

- subclass(child) : the class that inherits from another class.
- superclass(parent) : the class being inherited from.
  
To inherit from a class <b>extends</b> keyword is used.

Here, Car is sub-class and Vechile is super-class.
